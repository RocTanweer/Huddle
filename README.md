# Huddle Landing Page
A Landing page for a fictional **community building** website
<br>
This is a next level of simple Huddle Landing page that I did last time.
I used Sass instead of CSS because Sass provides some super natural powers that makes the whole project absolute DRY and Awesome!
So I would love to listen to any feedback given and I hope that my code will be useful for the Learners.
Thank You!
